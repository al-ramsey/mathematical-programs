Maths-related programs (written for fun):

1. brot: plots the mandelbrot set using matplotlib: the coordinates for several interesting regions are given at various magnifications.

2. gcd_and_bezout_finder: uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd and bezout coefficients of any two integers.

3. knights_tour: finds and plots a knight's tour (a Hamiltonian path of a knight on a chessboard).

4. polys_over_Fp: collection of functions investigating polynomials over the field F_p. In particular, calculating the number of reducible (or irreducible) polynomials of degree k over F_p for a given natural number k and prime p. Another function ("norm") displays the proportion of reducible polynomials of degree k as p tends to infinity. 

5. primes_and_all_they_entail: collection of functions to do with prime numbers, including a generator of prime numbers, a function which checks whether a number is prime (using the Miller-Rabin primality test) and a function which tries to figure out which are the least reliable 'witness numbers' when using this test.

6. trapped_knight_better: simulates the 'trapped knight' problem - if a knight is placed on an infinite chess board, enumerated spiralling outwards from the starting position, and moves to the lowest number possible, on which square will it get trapped (a graph is also plotted to visualise this)? What is the sequence of numbers corresponding to the squares it gets trapped on (if each previous one is removed)? And what if we start at a corner?
